# MLabS OT-2 protocols and designs.

These are most of the material I'm working on to use an OT-2 Opentrons Unit at my lab. Mostly, protocols I'm writing to try to automate some of the laboratory processes in the Microbiology Lab (www.arpbigidisba.com) at Balearic Institute of Sanitary Research (IdISBa - www.idisba.com) but also some custom designed labware and ideas to use with an OT-2 unit of Opentrons Robot (@Opentrons).

Please feel free to download, modify and or use any of these, but **DO IT AT YOUR OWN RESPONSABILITY**, protocols should have been tested properly, but there will be also Work In Progress protocols to kind of gather some help, feedback or advice.

Also, some labware I'm currently using is custom labware designed and 3D printed ad hoc to use with these protocols, you can find many of the files needed in the GitHub repository, please contact me at <gabriel.cabot(at)ssib.es> and I'll try to upload or reach to you.




**__Protocol Respository__**
