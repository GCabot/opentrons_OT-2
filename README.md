These are some of the protocols I'm writing to try to automate some of the laboratory processes in the Microbiology Lab (www.arpbigidisba.com) at Balearic Institute of Sanitary Research (IdISBa - www.idisba.com) with an OT-2 unit of Opentrons Robot.

Please feel free to download, modify and or use any of these, but do it at your own responsability, protocols should be tested properly, but maybe there is some Work In Progress (normally don't upload anything until sure it works, just in case, be aware). Also, some labware I'm currently using is custom labware designed and 3D printed ad hoc to use with these protocols, you can find many of the files needed in the GitHub repository, please contact me at <gabriel.cabot(at)ssib.es> and I'll try to upload or reach to you.
