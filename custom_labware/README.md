* STATUS Descriptions:
> DESIGN: This piece is just in the design software. There is no print test, nor fitting test.
>
> TESTING: This piece has been succesfully printed. But now it's been tested in the OT-2 to fit, proper usage.
>
> DONE: This piece has been tested for fitting within OT-2 Robot and/or the protocol which was designed for.
  
** This design is USABLE, but is in a TESTING step, so it could be modified to improve the design and avoid flaws.
